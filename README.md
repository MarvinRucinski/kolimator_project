# Electronic Targeting System

A shared success with pride on the podium! üèÜ

A project that started as an ambitious idea has transformed into a working prototype and won 2nd place at the Team Projects Conference organized by Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology. Together with the team, we created CTS ‚Äì a computer-assisted electronic sighting system.

Our solution allows for dynamic correction of the aiming mark, taking into account key weapon and ammunition parameters. We proved that it is possible to create a solid and functional system for a fraction of the market price of premium-class collimators.

I want to thank the team for the collaborative effort, Mateusz ≈ªurawski for his mentoring, and Comarch for supporting this event and us ‚Äì young innovators! üöÄ
